Press <em>@@@fkey_video@@@</em> to get the list of video modes your graphics card
supports. The highest mode your monitor can display is preselected.

It is possible that your monitor cannot be detected automatically. In that
case, select your preferred mode manually.

If your system has problems with the graphics card during the
